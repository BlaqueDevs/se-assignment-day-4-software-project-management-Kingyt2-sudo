This allows teams to adjust to changing requirements and deliver working software incrementally.  

**Advantages of Agile:**  
- *Flexibility:* Agile accommodates changing requirements even late in the project.  
- *Faster Delivery:* Working software is delivered in iterations, allowing early user feedback.  
- *Improved Collaboration:* Agile promotes close interaction between developers, stakeholders, and users.  
- *Higher Quality:* Continuous testing and feedback help improve software quality.  

**Disadvantages of Agile:**  
- *Less Predictable Costs & Timelines:* Constant changes can lead to budget overruns and shifting deadlines.  
- *Requires Active Client Involvement:* Frequent communication with stakeholders is necessary, which can be challenging.  
- *Difficult to Scale:** Large projects with multiple teams may face coordination issues.  

**Waterfall Methodology**  
Waterfall follows a *linear and structured* approach where each phase (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance) is completed before moving to the next. Once a stage is finalized, going back to make changes is difficult.  

**Advantages of Waterfall:**  
- *Clear Structure:** Well-defined phases make planning and execution straightforward.  
- *Easier Cost and Timeline Estimation:** Since all requirements are set upfront, budgeting and scheduling are more predictable.  
- *Less Client Involvement Required:** Unlike Agile, clients do not need to provide continuous feedback.  
- *Ideal for Fixed-Scope Projects:** Works well for projects with clear and stable requirements.  

**Disadvantages of Waterfall:**  
- *Lack of Flexibility:** Once a phase is completed, making changes is difficult and costly.  
- *Late Testing:** Errors are often found in the later stages, leading to higher fixing costs.  
- *Slower Delivery:** The final product is delivered at the end, meaning users do not get early access to working software.  
- *Risk of Project Failure:** If requirements were misunderstood at the start, the entire project could fail without early user feedback.   

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?### **When Agile is More Beneficial**
